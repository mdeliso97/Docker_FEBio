# Docker_FEBio

### Manual Installation Guide (based on Linux Ubuntu 22.04 LTS OS)

The guide is based on the following versions:
- FEBio Studio 2.7
- FEBio 4.7
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Operating system

1. Navigate to the link [Download](https://febio.org/downloads/) (you will need to create an account to access the download page of FEBio) and download the FEBio Studio installer corresponding to your operating system.

2. Extract the .ZIP file and copy it into the current directory of this project (same directory of the dockerfile, ./Docker_FEBio). To make things easier, rename the folder and the installer in it to the following naming convention: **FEBioStudio_2-7** and the installer as **FEBioStudio_linux-x64_2-7.run**.

3. Run the following command to start the installation of FEBio:

```
chmod +x Docker_FEBio/FEBioStudio_2-7/FEBioStudio_linux-x64_2-7.run

./FEBioStudio_linux-x64_2-7.run --mode unattended --prefix /FEBioStudio
```

5. Install Intel OpenAPI base toolkit to make sure libraries are detected correctly, it is not mandatory, some systems are able to detect the necessary libraries and dependencies by themselves. If it not the case for you, follow this step as well.

```
wget https://registrationcenter-download.intel.com/akdlm/IRC_NAS/e6ff8e9c-ee28-47fb-abd7-5c524c983e1c/l_BaseKit_p_2024.2.1.100_offline.sh

sh ./l_BaseKit_p_2024.2.1.100_offline.sh -a --silent --cli --eula accept

apt update

apt -y install cmake pkg-config build-essential
```

6. Check your installation:

```
which cmake pkg-config make gcc g++
```

You should get the following output if the installation was successful:

```
/usr/bin/cmake

/usr/bin/pkg-config

/usr/bin/make

/usr/bin/gcc

/usr/bin/g++
```

7. Create a directory in the FEBioStudio folder called "cbuild" you generated by installing it in step "3." and navigate into it.

```
mkdir /FEBioStudio/cbuild

cd /FEBioStudio/cbuild
```

8. Create and activate the virtual environment for the library manager "Intel OpenAPI"

```
. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh

source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
```

9. Follow the instructions in the BUILD.md file in the GitHub repositiory of FEBio Studio
